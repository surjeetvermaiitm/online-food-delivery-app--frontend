							Two Childhood friends started Food Villa in 2018 to deliver fresh, homemade meals to busy urbanites. Struggling to find healthy, affordable delivery options in the city, they launched their startup out of a small apartment kitchen. Through word of mouth, Food Villa quickly gained a following for its nutritious, reasonably priced dishes. Starting small with hustle and heart, John and Jane bootstrapped the company themselves.
							<br />
							<br />
							Today, Food Villa operates large kitchens in 3 cities while staying true to its roots. As the business expands, the founders remain hands-on, ensuring quality standards for every order. At its core, Food Villa provides a heartwarming homemade food alternative.
